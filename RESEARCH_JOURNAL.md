## 2023-05-20
- We finished and submitted our proposal

- We were able to successfully load MASSIVE dataset with its Polish subset
- We were able to successfully load Herbert model using huggingface/transformers
- We added linear classification layer to perform intent classification using representations from Herbert
- We ran train loop to make sure that our linear layer is learning on small subset of dataset and we are planning to run it on whole dataset
